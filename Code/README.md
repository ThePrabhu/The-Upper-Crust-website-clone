🍕 The Upper Crust

A simple and casual front-page website for a restaurant (pizza theme).
This project was created as part of my early web development learning journey to practice HTML, CSS, and especially responsiveness using media queries.

🧠 What I Learned

How to structure a basic restaurant landing page using HTML & CSS.

First-ever hands-on experience with CSS Media Queries.

Learned how responsiveness works — making a webpage adapt to different screen sizes.

Gained a better understanding of layout adjustments for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

Even though the responsiveness is done only to a certain extent, this project helped me build a strong foundation in responsive design concepts.

💻 Tech Used

HTML5

CSS3 (with Media Queries)

Visual Studio Code
